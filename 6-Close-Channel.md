That’s a really important question 👌 — **“where to close the channel”** is one of the trickiest parts of Go concurrency.

Let’s break it step by step.

---

## 🔑 Rule of Thumb for Closing Channels

1. **The sender is responsible for closing the channel.**
   Receivers should just read until it’s closed.
   Example: if worker goroutines send results, the "coordinator" (main or manager goroutine) should close it.

2. **Close a channel when no more values will ever be sent.**

   * If you close too early → workers will panic (`send on closed channel`).
   * If you never close → receivers waiting on `for range` get stuck (deadlock).

3. **Never close from multiple places.**
   Closing is a one-time action, so decide *one owner* of that channel.

---

## 🔎 How to Decide Where to Close

Ask yourself:

* **Who writes to the channel?**

  * That goroutine/group must decide when writing is done.
* **When are they done writing?**

  * Usually after some `WaitGroup.Wait()`.

👉 So:

* You close the channel **after all senders finish**.
* You don’t close it *inside the workers*, because multiple goroutines can’t safely close the same channel.

---

## 🛠 Applying to Your Code

In your example:

* Workers (`incrementWorker`, `decrementWorker`) **send to the channel**.
* So, **main goroutine is the “coordinator”**.
* Once all workers finish (`wg.Wait()`), **we know no more values will be sent**.
* ✅ That’s the exact moment to close the channel.

```go
go func() {
    wg.Wait()     // wait until ALL workers are done sending
    close(queue)  // now it's safe: no more sends will happen
}()
```

This way:

* Workers run, send results into `queue`.
* Reader (`for result := range queue`) reads until the channel is closed.
* Once `wg.Wait()` ensures workers are done, main closes `queue`.
* `for range` loop ends gracefully when channel is empty and closed.

---

## 🔦 How to Detect the Wrong Closing Place

* **If you close inside a worker** → panic: `send on closed channel`.
* **If you close before `wg.Wait()`** → some worker might still be sending → panic.
* **If you forget to close** → your `for range` loop will never exit → deadlock.

👉 So the mental model is:

* Workers send.
* `wg.Wait()` ensures all workers are done.
* After that, you close.

---

## 🚀 Simple Visual

```
workers (senders) ---> queue ---> main (receiver)

close(queue) happens only when ALL senders are done
```

Perfect 👍 Let’s walk through a **timeline diagram** for your program with goroutines, the channel, and the `WaitGroup`.

I’ll keep it simple and ASCII-style.

---

### 🏗 Setup

* You start **10 increment workers** and **10 decrement workers**.
* Each worker:

  * Updates the counter.
  * Sends result into `queue`.
  * Calls `wg.Done()` when finished.
* `main`:

  * Loops over `queue` (`for result := range queue`).
  * Waits for workers.
  * Closes `queue`.

│  ──────> wg.Wait() (blocks until all workers call Done)
│  ──────> close(queue)  (safe now, no more sends!)

### 🧩 Why `close(queue)` *after* `wg.Wait()`?

* If you **close early** (before `wg.Wait()`):

  * Some worker might still be sending.
  * Boom 💥 → `panic: send on closed channel`.

* If you **never close**:

  * Your `for range queue` runs forever.
  * Deadlock ❌.

* If you **close after `wg.Wait()`**:

  * All workers finished sending.
  * Channel is closed.
  * `for range` drains remaining values and exits gracefully. ✅

---

### ✔ Correct Pattern in Your Code

```go
go func() {
    wg.Wait()     // wait until ALL workers done
    close(queue)  // now it's safe
}()
```

---

👉 That’s why **the coordinator (main)** closes the channel, and the signal for “safe to close” is **after `wg.Wait()`**.
